# Car-Evaluation-model-Decision-Tree
This project focuses on predicting **medical insurance costs** using a **Decision Tree Regressor**.  
The model learns patterns from demographic and lifestyle-related features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region to estimate insurance charges.

## 📌 Project Overview

Medical insurance costs vary significantly based on multiple factors.  
This project applies **machine learning regression techniques** to predict insurance charges accurately using structured data.

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- `age` – Age of the individual  
- `sex` – Gender  
- `bmi` – Body Mass Index  
- `children` – Number of children/dependents  
- `smoker` – Smoking status  
- `region` – Residential region  
- `charges` – Medical insurance cost (**target variable**)

Categorical variables are encoded using **One-Hot Encoding**.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle categorical features using OneHotEncoder  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train Decision Tree Regressor  
5. Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

## 📈 Model Performance

The model achieved the following results on the test dataset:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `20,976,585.24`  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** `4,580.02`  
- **R² Score:** `0.8649`

These results indicate that the model explains approximately **86.5%** of the variance in medical insurance costs.
